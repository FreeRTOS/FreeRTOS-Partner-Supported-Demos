/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" task -  This only executes every five seconds but has the highest
 * priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  Its main function is to 
 * check that all the standard demo tasks are still operational.  The check
 * task will write an error message to the console should an error be detected
 * within any of the demo tasks.  The check task also toggles the LED defined
 * by mainCHECK_LED every 5 seconds while the system is error free, with the
 * toggle rate increasing to every 500ms should an error occur.
 * 
 * "Reg test" tasks - These fill the registers with known values, then check
 * that each register still contains its expected value.  Each task uses
 * different values.  The tasks run with very low priority so get preempted very
 * frequently.  A register containing an unexpected value is indicative of an
 * error in the context switching mechanism.
 *
 * See the online documentation for this demo for more information on interrupt
 * usage.
