## PIC24 dsPIC33 FreeRTOS Demo

## Summary

This repository contains the freeRTOS demos for Microchip device families like PIC24, dsPIC33E, dsPIC33F and dsPIC33C.
For the demo applications, MPLAB X and MPLAB XC16 are the preferred IDE and compiler respectively with which to build the FreeRTOS demos. 
The board to be used to run the demo is Explorer 16/32 (Explore 16/32 is backward compatible with Explorer 16).
The version of freeRTOS used in this demo is : freeRTOS v10

## Related Documentation

+ The FreeRTOS/Source directory contains the FreeRTOS source code, and contains
  its own readme file.

+ See http://www.freertos.org/a00017.html for full details of the directory 
  structure and information on locating the files you require.
  
+ See http://www.freertos.org/portpic24_dspic.html#DemoApp for full details above the demos.
  
The easiest way to use FreeRTOS is to start with one of the pre-configured demo 
application projects (found in the pic24-dspic33-freertos-demo/Demo directory).  That way you will
have the correct FreeRTOS source files included, and the correct include paths
configured.  Once a demo application is building and executing you can remove
the demo application file, and start to add in your own application source
files.
